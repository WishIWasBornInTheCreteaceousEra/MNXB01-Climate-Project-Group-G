# MNXB01-Climate-Project-Group-G
This is the final project in ROOT for MNXB01 2019 (Lund University) Group G!

Initially we met up and discussed how we should go about reading the data files. Rebecca developed the skeleton of the code
and Yasser subsequently produced a method to skip and ignore lines effectively. Both methods were merged by Dolev which is 
the final version of the Reader. Rebecca and Dolev then worked to develop the split function that sorts the data into the relevant
data vectors.

Subsequently Rebecca produced the function tempOnDay with some collaboration with Dolev, Yasser produced the function Seasons 
that was ported in by Dolev, Andre developed the tempPerDay function that was then updated by Dolev to match the current Data
structure. Additionally, Andre fit gaussians to tempOnDay.

The functions tempDistYear... were initially developed by Yasser and Andre, updated to match the Data Structure by Dolev and 
further refined by Yasser.

Finally, Andre and Yasser began to develop and handed it over to Rebecca and Dolev in order to polish the tempDistYear... functions.
